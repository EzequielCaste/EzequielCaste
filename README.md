# Ezequiel Castellanos

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ezequiel and I'm a Front-end Developer.
I specialize in JavaScript and have experience working with React. I've worked with backend technologies too, such as Nodejs, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

I am a team player, motivated to learn, and an open-minded person. I'm always looking for new challenges and learning new things to improve my knowledge and give the best of myself in a job.

Previously I have worked at [WIP-IT](https://www.wipit.net/) where we developed a web application used by recruiters across various countries. My main responsibilities included developing and testing new features for the application and their time estimation. Most of them were related to the UI of the app.
